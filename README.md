# Muddle

Muddle is a C# port of popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). This a one of my project under the `Everything in C# (EICS)` series.

## Why named Muddle?

The word Muddle can sometime explains as puzzle, which match the game nature. Actually it was due to the fact that this project is made from [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) UI component and run on Microsoft [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) technology. Combining MudBlazor and Wordle gives the name Muddle.  

### Is it the same as the official Wordle?

No. This project was made up for my `Everything in C#` article series and mainly for fun only. Therefore features like Facebook sharing and those record tracking features may not be implemented in foreseeable future.

However, this project also has features over the original Wordle:

- You can clone this repo, customize the game and then deploy at your site.
- You can supply your own word-list.
- You can config how many attempts allowed for the user to guess.
- The word list can contain words with variable length.
- The user can start a new game by clicking a button instead of reload.
- There is no limit on how many times a user can play per day.
